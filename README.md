This is the eighth project in Treehouse Python tech degree, an extension of 
[project six](https://github.com/jhoover4/mineral-catalog).

Project six is hosted on [Heroku](https://mineral-catalog.herokuapp.com). This project will replace it upon completion.

## Description

As part of your job, you’ve been asked to build a website that displays information about various minerals. The home 
page of the site contains a list of all of the minerals in a database. Clicking on a mineral’s name opens a page that 
displays information about the mineral.

- Open minerals.json and look at the attributes of a mineral. Write a model to store the mineral data. Write a script to 
that constructs a mineral model instance for each mineral in minerals.json and saves them to a SQLite database.
- Create a layout template for the app.
- Create a template and view to show the names of all the minerals.
- Create a mineral details template and view.
- Write unit tests to test that models, classes, and other functions are working correctly.
- Add css throughout the app to make changes match provided files.
- Queries to the database should be optimized and take no longer than 10ms to complete.
- Add ability to filter minerals by first letter in name, grouping, and another filter of your choice.
- Add search bar with ability to full-text search the app.

## Extra Credit

- Display the most common or important details at the top of the details list. You can decide on what order to display 
them in.
The other miscellaneous details can be in any order.
- Add a link that goes to a random mineral details page.
